# Hey there! :wave: Welcome to my Offensive Security journey! 
This is a place where I would like to document my progress in learning offensive security. 

### My long-term goal is to become a **Cybersecurit Expert**, specialized in Offensive Security :feelsgood:.
Also I want to increase my Linux skills, so everything (or at least 90% :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) here will be done using Arch Linux <img src="https://edent.github.io/SuperTinyIcons/images/svg/arch_linux.svg" width="100" title="Arch Linux"><br>308 bytes</td> (okay okay ... EndeavourOS :unamused:)
And Vim <img src="https://edent.github.io/SuperTinyIcons/images/svg/vim.svg" width="100" title="Vim"><br>754 bytes</td>

I will also try to add problems I'll face with Arch and solutions to them :relieved:
