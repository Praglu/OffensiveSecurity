# Hey there! :wave: Welcome to my Offensive Security journey! 
This is a place where I would like to document my progress in learning offensive security. 

### My long-term goal is to become a **Cybersecurit Expert**, specialized in Offensive Security :feelsgood:.
Also I want to increase my Linux skills, so everything (or at least 90% :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) here will be done using Arch Linux ![alt text](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2d381c1b375aecc790086e9f81a7fb9610fe73c874bba3d7425846bd78be1352/68747470733a2f2f6564656e742e6769746875622e696f2f537570657254696e7949636f6e732f696d616765732f7376672f617263685f6c696e75782e737667) (okay okay ... EndeavourOS :unamused:)

I will also try to add problems I'll face with Arch and solutions to them :relieved:
